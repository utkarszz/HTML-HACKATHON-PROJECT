  <p><b>In HTML, "boilerplate" refers to a standard, pre-written set of code that provides the essential structure and foundational elements for a web page. It's a template that developers use as a starting point, saving time and ensuring consistency across projects.
Key elements typically found in an HTML boilerplate include:
<!DOCTYPE html>: The document type declaration, which tells the browser what version of HTML is being used (in this case, HTML5).
<html lang="en">: The root element of the HTML page, specifying the language of the document (e.g., English).
<head>: Contains metadata about the HTML document, such as:
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding for the document, ensuring proper display of various characters.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Configures the viewport for responsive design, ensuring the page adapts to different screen sizes. 
<title>Page Title</title>: Sets the title that appears in the browser tab or window.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">: Links to external CSS files for styling.
<body>: Contains the visible content of the web page, such as text, images, and other elements.
<script src="main.js"></script>: Links to external JavaScript files for interactivity.
Benefits of using an HTML boilerplate:
Efficiency: Reduces development time by providing a ready-to-use foundation.
Consistency: Ensures that all web pages within a project adhere to a standard structure.
Best Practices: Often includes elements and configurations that follow web development best practices, such as SEO-friendly meta tags and responsive design settings.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Helps ensure that the website renders correctly across different web browsers.</b></p>
