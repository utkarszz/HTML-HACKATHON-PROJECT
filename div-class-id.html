  <p><b>Function of Div tag: The role of this tag is to create the divisions in a webpage that can contain different content as per the requirement of a user. The Web designing services can never be completed without this essential tag. Earlier, before the origination of div, designers used to code tables in order to make specified partitions within the webpages. But with the changing of SEO parameters, search engine started neglecting the table content within the website. This created a big problem for all websites created in earlier format. So the div came out as the absolute remedy to this issue.

How it works: As it is a basic tag that is used within a web designing, the syntax of it is too simple to code.
<div id=”” class=””>Content</div>
This simple code creates a division within the webpage and allows the programmer to allot the amount of space to it. Then it may be applied with width:10%, 20% or by simple entering the number of pixels i.e. width:50px. With this,, the page will be displayed with a portion of 50px. This makes an easy to implement designing trend for all the website developers.</b></p>

<p><b>The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

In the following example we have three <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". All of the three <div> elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section</b></p>
